\section{Implementing a FIR filter}

\subsection{Linear, time-invariant systems}
For every possible input signal $x$, a system $H$ maps it to an output signal $H(x) = y$.

\begin{center}\input{assets/system.tex}\end{center}
A linear system is one which satisfies the superposition and scaling properties:

\textbf{Superposition property:}\\
A system $H$ satisfies the superposition property if applying the system to a sum
of two signals $x_1$ and $x_2$ is equivalent to applying the system to the two signals,
and then summing the results.
$$H(x_1 + x_2) = H(x_1) + H(x_2)$$

\textbf{Scaling Property:}\\
A system $H$ satisfies the scaling property if applying a system to a signal that is scaled by a factor
is equivalent to first applying the system to the signal and then scaling the result by that factor.
$$H(\lambda x_1) = \lambda H(x_1)$$


\textbf{Time-invariance property:}\\
A system is time invariant if shifting the input signal in time and then
applying the system gives an output equivalent to if you first apply the system, 
and then shift the result in time.

\begin{center}\input{assets/shift.tex}\end{center}

A system that is both linear and time-invariant is called a LTI system.

\subsection{Impulse response}
The impulse response of a $h$ system is the output when the system is applied to the delta function $\delta$.
$$h = H(\delta)$$

\begin{center}\input{assets/impulse_response.tex}\end{center}
Since any input signal is a sum of scaled and shifted delta functions, applying an 
LTI system to an input signal is equivalent to taking the corresponding scalings and 
shifts of the impulse response and adding them together. 
Thus an LTI system can be completely described by its impulse response.

\begin{center}\input{assets/linearity.tex}\end{center}

Thus it's easy to see that applying an LTI system onto a signal is equivalent to 
convolving the signal with the impulse response of the system.

\subsection{Response of Sinusoids}


\subsection{Frequency Response}
If a sinusoid is fed into a time-invariant linear system, then the output signal is always sinusoidal.

Frequency response

The frequency response of the system is equal to the DFT of the impulse response,
taking the magnitude of each phasor.

\subsection{Filter Design}
Instead of using a system's impulse response to find its frequency response, 
you can use a desired frequency response and perform an IDFT to produce the 
kernel for a system that has that desired frequency response.

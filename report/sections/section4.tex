\section{Parametric filtering using the Z-transform}
\subsection{The Z-transform of a signal}
For a real time domain signal $x:\mathbb{Z}\to\mathbb{R}$, its $z$ transform is a function $X:\mathbb{C}\to\mathbb{C}$, where
$$X(z)=\sum_{n=-\infty}^{\infty}x[n]z^{-n}.$$

It can be seen that the DTFT is the same as the Z-transform but with the domain restricted to the 
unit circle on the complex plane.

\subsection{The transfer function of a system}
The transfer function of a system is equal to the Z-transform of its impulse response.
$$H(z)$$

TODO:finish this

For an LTI system suppose that $x$ is an arbitrary input signal and $y$ is the output.
Let $X$ and $Y$ be the Z-transforms of these signals respectively.

\subsection{Desmos visualization of the transfer function}
I created a demonstration on how the positions of poles and zeroes in the 
transfer function of the system impact the frequency magnitude response of the system.

\subsection{Biquadratic filter implementation}
This is implemented recursively.

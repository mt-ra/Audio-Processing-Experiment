\section{Audio Spectrograms}
\subsection{Disclaimer}
I want to start with the disclaimer that I do not study EE and that
prior to starting this project for COMP4121 I had no knowledge of digital signal processing.
The only things I knew before were from doing music production as a hobby.
In short, some of this report may be misinformation. Have fun reading!

\subsection{Audio signals}
An discrete signal $x$ is a sequence of real valued samples $(\dots, x[-1], x[0], x[1], x[2], \dots)$.
These real numbers correspond to the voltage that would be held across a speaker at each point in time.
The number of samples per second of audio is known as the \emph{sampling rate}.

\subsection{Interpreting DFT output}
Suppose that a DFT is applied on a real signal of length $N$ (a power of 2).

The DFT provides how a signal can be written as the summation of phasors,\\
with frequencies $F=\{0, \pm 1, \pm 2, \dots, \pm (\frac{N}{2}-1), \frac{N}{2}\}$ cycles per window.

$$c[t]=\frac{1}{N}\sum_{k\in F}\hat{c}[k]e^{i\omega k t}$$
Where $\omega=\frac{2\pi}{N}$ is defined \emph{here} such that the phasor $e^{i\omega t}$ completes 1 cycles
per window (N samples). For negative $k$, the expression
$c[k]$ is defined to be $c[N-k]$.

For example applying a DFT on a complex array $c$ of length $N$ gives an array $\hat{c}$
of complex numbers. 
For integers $0\leq k \leq \frac{N}{2}-1$,
the value of $\hat{c}(k)$ the initial value of the phasor that has a frequency of $k$ cycles per window.

Below is a diagram of how fast each phasor spins for a window size of $N$.
For example the phasor corresponding to entry 1 of the array $\hat{c}$ rotates
one cycle per window. The phasor corresponding to entry 6 rotates in the negative direction
at a rate of 2 cycles per window.

\subsection{Short time Fourier transform}
To analyse how the frequencies of a audio signal change over time, we can
divide the audio stream into overlapping \emph{windows} of samples.
The DFT is applied to each window, which gives information about the frequencies
present at that moment in time.

For best results, a windowing function is applied to each window, in order
to taper the edges of the signal to zero to avoid discontinuities at the edges.

\subsection{Spectrograms}
A spectrogram is a visual tool used to see what frequencies are present at 
each moment in time.
This information is represented as a heatmap, where the input variables are on the $x$ and $y$ axes,
and the magnitude of output is represented using colour/brightness.
In the example screenshot below, frequency (on the $y$-axis) is shown on a logarithmic scale.
Most spectrograms represent frequency on a log scale because humans perceive pitch logarithmically.

It is a tool commonly used in electronic music production. 
It makes use of the STFT to determine the frequency composition of the signal
at each moment in time.

A setting that can be changed by the user is the FFT window size.
The size determines the frequency-resolution vs time-resolution tradeoff.
The wider the windows, the more frequency bins there are resulting in more 
frequency-resolution. However you will be capturing a larger portion of audio,
which wouldn't work well if the frequencies are changing quickly over time, resulting in 
reduced time-resolution (even if overlapping windows are used).

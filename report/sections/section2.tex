\section{Implementing a Brick-Wall Filter}

The link to the GitHub repo is \href{https://github.com/mt-ra/Audio-Processing-Experiment}{https://github.com/mt-ra/Audio-Processing-Experiment}.

The goal was to create a program that processes a .wav file.

Dependencies on:
\begin{itemize}
    \item boost/circular\_buffer
    \item portsf (C library for reading and writing wav files)
    \item fftw (C library for FFT)
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Writing wrappers for the C libraries}
I started by writing C++ OOP style wrappers around the fftw library.
